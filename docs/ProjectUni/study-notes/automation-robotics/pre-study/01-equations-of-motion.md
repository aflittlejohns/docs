The following notes are from [Equations of Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion) up to Dynamic Equations of Motion

## Equations of Motion

Equations of motion describe the behaviour of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic 
variables, usually spatial coordinates and time, but may include momentum.

#### Equation of Momentum
$$
p = mv
$$
- **momentum** is $$p$$;
- **mass** is $$m$$;
- **velocity** is $$v$$;

Mathematical functions of motion are defined in a [Euclidean Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space).

## Types

There are two main description of motion: dynamics and [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics)
