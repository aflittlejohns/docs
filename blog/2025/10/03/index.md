2. [Central User Management with "User Management Component"(UMC)](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109780337/central-user-management-with-user-management-component-(umc)-?dti=0&lc=en-GB)

#### Summary
In a word, YES. The article `Network concepts for Industrial Automation Networks` provided some perfect info and deserves re-reading!!

Not what I wanted to see... But, hey... Could be worse!!

### Unable to employ slice access?

**The Issue**
In FB169 Network 2,The address is not occupied by a tag.

```text
    T     %LW0    
```
In the block interface LW0 is part of a UDT typed variable. Therefore, been trying to use "slice" access, that is;

```text
    T varName.W0
```
However, the IDE is adding a % so the attempted symbolic address becomes absolute. Doh!

In researching the problem came across this [Difference between standard and optimized block access](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/67655611/difference-between-standard-and-optimized-block-access?dti=0&lc=en-GB)

Created an issue to [Change the S7-300 CPU to S7-1500](https://github.com/pfAuto/project-uni/issues/15), which is capable of employing "Optimized Blocks", unlike S7-300/400 CPU's

## For another day...

### Continuous Integration with TIA Portal
